# LIP-segmentation-fcn
Train a simple FCN to do segmentation with LIP dataset.
The FCN network structure is from [MarvinTeichmann/tensorflow-fcn] (https://github.com/MarvinTeichmann/tensorflow-fcn). Thanks a lot for this simple but effective work!
The default train dataset I use is [Look into Person] (http://www.sysu-hcp.net/lip/). You can use different datasets to do the training with a bit edition in my code.

Here are some demo results:
